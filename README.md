Library Management Tool

Using this tool you can manage your Library (Personal Physical Library) smoothly. I have a mini library at my home. It has a variety of Genres. When I first arranged the books in the Library it was easy to remember the location of the books which I mostly read but later it became a nightmare. I tried arranging the books by their genre but the issue was I had alot of different genres plus the books I have are of various sizes. This made it look awful. Thats why I have created this tool.

As of now, this tool has following features:

1. Add book details

    When a user selects this option the tool will ask four things. Title, Author, Genre and the location where you have kept the book in the library.
  
2. Search for a book

3. Delete a book
